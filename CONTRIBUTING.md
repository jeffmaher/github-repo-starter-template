# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to this repository!

I ([@jeffmaher](https://github.com/jeffmaher/)) am currently working on this repository as a hobby project. There are no defined timelines for features/updates.

[Things I'd like to add to the repository are written in GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jeffmaher/github-repo-starter-template/issues), but might not be very well documented since they're mostly just reminders to myself that I want to add something. Feel free to add [feature requests via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jeffmaher/github-repo-starter-template/issues/new) if there's something you want or would like to have. Feature requests may or may not be worked on, and there are no timelines for ones that are accepted.

With that said, if there's something you'd to add to the repo and can write the code yourself, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. I can't promise a timeline for reviewing, but I'll try to review within 1 month of submission. If you do submit a pull request, please make sure that you've tested your changes. I'll do a second test of it before merging anything. Please follow the pull request template, as anything that doesn't include the required information will be closed.

Questions for me about the repository can be submitted via GitHub Issues, and tagged with the `question` label. Again, I'm not sure when I'll be able to answer, but will aim to respond within 1 month.
